# Optical Illusion Fan Animation 🎭

This is a cool little **optical illusion animation** made with **React**. Even though the balls move **in a straight line**, it **looks like they’re moving in a circle** because of how the bars are rotated. It’s a fun visual trick that makes the motion feel curved.

## 🎥 How It Works
- There are **12 horizontal bars** arranged in a circular pattern.
- Each bar has a **small ball** that moves back and forth in a straight line.
- The bars are **rotated** around a central point, which makes it **look like the balls are moving in a circular path** (but they’re not! 🤯).
- The animation has a slight **delay for each ball**, making the effect even smoother.

## 🛠️ What’s Used
- **React** – Handles the component structure.
- **CSS Animations** – For smooth movement.
- **No extra libraries** – Just simple **React & CSS**.
